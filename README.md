# Project simple calculator

### What is this about?

- for desktop (not responsive), build a simple calculator with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- the calculator should look like [this](https://btholt.github.io/intro-to-web-dev-v2/calculator.html)

#### Tips for HTML and CSS

- do HTML and CSS first, than do JavaScript
- use `button`s (as this makes it pretty much automatically accessible)
- use flexbox
- have the "gutter" created in overwriting the `<button>` style and have the black background shining through (see commented out CSS parts)
- use `:last-child` to style orange buttons

#### Tips for JavaScript

- use `console.log` often (and don't forget to take it out in the end)
- if you end up using more than ~80 lines of code - rethink
- use many small functions where each one does one thing
- tutor used 8 functions for their solution so you get an idea how many you'd probably need
- have variables defined where they stay in scope, as you need to keep track of them
- add an event listener to (each) button
